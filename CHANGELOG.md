## 1.1.1 — 2026-09-26

- Distinguish verified, unverified and failed attestation evidence.
- Show unknown security status when current trusted metadata is unavailable.
- Harden certificate paths, MDS expiry/revocation checks and advisory verification.
- Disable persistent history and website recording by default; remove automatic CSV exports.
- Add stateless mode, optional OS-keychain-backed history encryption and private atomic storage.
- Prevent CSV formula injection and preserve critical findings over lower-severity warnings.
- Lock dependencies with hashes and pin CI actions to reviewed commit IDs.
- Require signing and notarization for public versioned releases.

Local macOS builds are ad-hoc signed test builds. Publisher signing requires the
credentials documented in RELEASING.md. Windows and physical-key validation remain
separate from the automated regression suite.
